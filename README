RocketMinsta is a modification of Nexuiz 2.5.2 which aims to extend regular minstagib gameplay, primary minsta+hook CTF. If this tells you nothing, you might as well stop reading...

 -- Installation --

There are several ways to get the mod running on your server. But first, you will need to install a QuakeC compiller. I suggest FTEQCC from this repository: http://git.xonotic.org/xonotic/xonotic.git
Once you built/installed it, copy file EXAMPLE_config.sh as config.sh, and then open the resulting file with your prefered text editor. This file is the configuration of build.sh, which is used to compile and install the mod. Things you'll likely need to change are NEXDATA and QCC. NEXDATA is the directory where mod files will be installed. If you build on your server machine, you most likely should set it to the ~/.nexuiz/data/ directory of the user which the Nexuiz server runs by. Otherwise, you should create a separate directory (outside of your cloned repository) for the mod, and then copy files from there into your server's nexuiz data. The QCC variable is an ordered list of QuakeC compillers to try. If none of them are present, the build script will give up. If the fteqcc binary is not in your PATH, you should append it's location to that list. When you're done with the config, save it and then simply run build.sh. After the installation is finished, the script will tell you what should be done next. NOTE: as said above, if you're not building on your server machine, you should copy relevant files later manually. However, it is possible to automate remote installations over SFTP using the release system, it's explained below. You might also want to take a look into RocketMinsta settings, all of them are found in rocketminsta.cfg. However, you should NOT edit this file, put your changes into your server config instead. It's also good to keep your RM configuration separate, and reference it from the main config with an "exec".

 -- Updating --
note: this section assumes you're building on the server machine

There is a helper script that simplifies the process of updating the repo, reinstalling the mod and reloading it's configuration on the server (through RCON) down to a single command. Much like build.sh, it's own configuration file, which is customized in the same fashion: copy EXAMPLE_updconfig.sh as updconfig.sh and edit the later. RCON_ADDRESS, RCON_PORT, and RCON_PASSWORD should match your server's address, port and rcon_password variable, respectively. NOTE: If you haven't customized any RocketMinsta related settings on your server, it's better to replace "exec server.cfg" with "exec rocketminsta.cfg". If you keep your RM-related configuration separate, it's good to put "exec rocketminsta.cfg" first, and then "exec what_your_config_is_called.cfg". If you're using an rm-custom config, just "exec rm-custom/cfgname.cfg" is enough. Once you're done, you can forget about this all and just use ./update.sh when you want to update your server. Note: update.sh will not do anything unless an update is available. To enforce an update, run ./update.sh force.

 -- Release system --

RocketMinsta features a simple release system, which allows you to quickly generate (possibly customized) precompilled packages for the end user (server host) to simply extract over their nexdata. However, it's more flexible than that, and can be used as another upgrade tool (see: EXAMPLE_releaseconfig_SFTP.sh). It's configured much like everything else, take one of the example configs and copy it to releaseconfig.sh. Note: the release system also supports custom configs, which have a name of releaseconfig_CONFIGNAME.sh. These files, much like other configs, are ignored by GIT. All of the configuration options are commented in both example configs, so you shouldn't have a problem customizing it. If in doubt, the defaults work in most cases. Once you're done, run ./build.sh release to generate a release package. This method will use the main releaseconfig.sh, to use one of your custom configurations, try ./build.sh release CONFIGNAME (with a CONFIGNAME of 'derp', the script will use releaseconfig_derp.sh). Note: the SFTP example does NOT generate a package, it just uploads it's contents to the server. The SFTP example also utilized RCON in the same way as update.sh does, see the previous section.
